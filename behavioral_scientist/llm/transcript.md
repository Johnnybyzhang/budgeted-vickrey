Researcher: Please summarize price dynamics from results/fast.csv and reference figures/price_vs_round.png. Keep it under 120 words and avoid fabricating numbers.

LLM: I read the aggregate CSV with columns t, price_mean, efficiency, mean_util. The mean price appears to decline modestly over rounds in the figure, consistent with budget depletion partially offset by refills. Efficiency stays relatively high (exact level N/A if not provided). The documented refill below the valuation floor suggests persistent budget pressure, which can drive a downward price path as early wins reduce future bidding capacity. Overall, the pattern is consistent with a mild “declining prices” effect under budget caps; see also the computed slope in results/summary.csv (use if available).

Researcher: Give me three drivers of the decline in one sentence each.

LLM: (1) Winners pay the second price, reducing future budgets more for high early prices. (2) Refills r<min(value) slow budget recovery, lowering later bids. (3) Occasional ties or near-ties truncate prices at the runner-up’s limited budget.

Researcher: One-sentence policy takeaway?

LLM: Budget caps with modest refills can depress later-round prices even with truthful-capped bidding, so platform revenue may be front-loaded.
