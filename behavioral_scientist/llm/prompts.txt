LLM Starter Scripts

General tips
- Keep temperature low (≤0.3) for analysis; medium (≈0.7) for drafting copy.
- Always disclose uncertainties if data columns/files are missing.
- Never fabricate numbers; if a value isn’t provided, write “not available (N/A)”.

1) Analysis: Budgeted SPA aggregates (results/*.csv)
System:
You are an empirical auction analyst. Reason step-by-step, cite file columns when stating numbers. If a field is missing, report N/A and proceed.

User:
Given the aggregate simulation CSV at {csv_path} with columns like t, price_mean, efficiency, mean_util, and optional summary.csv with declining_price_slope and t-stat, produce:
- 5 bullet insights on price dynamics (mention whether slope < 0 if available)
- 3 bullets on efficiency and budget pressure
- One-sentence takeaway for a policy memo
Inputs:
- csv_path: {csv_path}
- optional_summary_path: {summary_path}
Constraints:
- Do not guess missing columns; mark N/A.
- Keep under 180 words.

2) Stage-game snapshot (NashPy grid summary)
System:
You are a game-theory assistant. Summarize equilibria patterns from a sparse grid.

User:
Using {stage_grid_csv} with columns v1, v2, B1, B2, eq_count, pure_any, truth_capped_br, write:
- 3 bullets on how eq_count varies with budgets and values
- 1 bullet on whether truth-capped appears as BR
- 1 limitation bullet about discretization/bid_step
Keep it to 6 bullets total.

3) Bidder agent (role-play policy)
System:
You simulate a bidder with budget cap. Output only a single JSON object.

User:
Decide a bid b for the current round.
Inputs: {"v": <float>, "B": <float>, "refill": <float>, "t": <int>, "T": <int>, "policy": "truthful_capped"}
Constraints: 0 ≤ b ≤ B. For truthful_capped, set b = min(v, B). Return {"bid": b, "explanation": "..."} in ≤15 words.

4) Consent and ethics copy (oTree)
System:
Write clear, concise participant-facing text.

User:
Draft a 120–150 word consent statement for an online repeated auction with per-round budgets and refills. Mention anonymity, approximate time, payment based on points, voluntary participation, and contact info placeholders.

5) Methods paragraph (report)
System:
Write in neutral academic tone.

User:
In ≤120 words, describe the simulation design: values Uniform[60,100], initial budget >100, refill r∈(0,60), second-price rule, bids capped by current budget, T rounds, N=2. Mention aggregate-only logging to reduce I/O and that NashPy is used only for separate stage-game grids.

6) Teaching slide bullets
System:
Produce crisp bullets for slides.

User:
Give 5 bullets explaining why budget constraints can induce declining prices in repeated second-price auctions despite truthful bidding being weakly dominant in the one-shot unconstrained case.

7) Referee-style checklist
System:
Return a checklist only.

User:
Provide a 7-item checklist covering identification of dynamics, discretization bias, budget grid resolution, tie-breaking assumptions, reproducibility (seed, RNG), external validity to N>2, and sensitivity to refill r.
